## CSS3 Media queries

CSS Media Queries are a feature in CSS3 which allows you to specify when certain CSS rules should be applied. This allows you to apply a special CSS for mobile, or adjust a layout for print.

There are three ways to invoke media-query-dependent styles.

* First of all, as stylesheets in the link element of HTML or XHTML:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="all and (color)" href="/style.css">
```

Secondly, in XML:

```html
<?xml-stylesheet media="all and (color)" rel="stylesheet" href="/style.css" ?>
```

And finally, in CSS stylesheets using @import rules:

```css
@import url("/style.css") all and (color);
```

Or using @media rules:

```css
@media all and (color) { /* one or more rule sets... */ }
```

There are currently 13 media features catered for in the specification: width, height, device-width, device-height, orientation, aspect-ratio,device-aspect-ratio, color, color-index, monochrome, resolution, scan, and grid. All but orientation, scan, and grid can accept min- and max- prefixes as well.
